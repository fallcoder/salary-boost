# SalaryBoost App
The SalaryBoost App is a pyhton based tool designed to upadate a list of salaries by adding a bonus to each salary. It validates user input, updates the salaries and saves them to a file for further reference.
This project is simple yet effective for learning Python fundamentals such as functions, file handling, loops and error handling.

## Features
* **user input validation:** ensures that the entered salaries and bonus are integers
* **interactive interface:** prompts the user to input salaries and a bonus dynamically
* **file export:** save the updated salaries to a .txt file
* **error handling:** provides clear feedback for invalid inputs
